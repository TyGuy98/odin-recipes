    <h2>About the dish</h2>
        <!--Paragrahs with a little info on our dish-->
        <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter,
        Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little
        lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>

        <p>You may be wondering: "Do I really need a recipe for buttered noodles?" The answer, of course, is yes. This kid-friendly recipe results
        in perfect noodles tossed in exactly the right amount of butter. Once you try these four-ingredient buttered noodles, you'll never go back to your old method again.</p>
